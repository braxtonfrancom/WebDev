# [Intro to JavaScript](../JavaScript.md)


**Jot down your impressions and questions about JavaScript on your mud cards**

## When picking up a new language there are only 2 things you need to learn

0.  **Syntax** - the *form* of the language
    *   What symbols is the language comprised of?
    *   What order may I arrange the symbols of the language?
1.  **Semantics** - the *meaning* of the language
    *   Is this particular ordering of symbols nonsense?
    *   What meaning do these symbols have when arranged this way?


This is famous quote that is valid **syntactically** but not **semantically**:

![Colorless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously](./12-colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously.png "Colorless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously")

Despite the lack of grammatical errors, this sentence doesn't make sense.
