# Action Items

*   Call on 2 designated questioners



# [JavaScript Functions](../JavaScript.md#functions)

One of JavaScript's most distinct features is that functions are first-class values. 

There are a few ways to declare functions in JavaScript.  I'll show the most simple and flexible way now.  



# [Function Parameters in JavaScript](../JavaScript.md#function-parameters)

*   If JavaScript is dynamically typed, does it care about the number of parameters passed to functions?
*   What happens in JavaScript when I call a function with *too few* arguments?
*   What happens in JavaScript when I call a function with *too many* arguments?



# [Functions are Values in JavaScript](../JavaScript.md#functions-are-values-in-javascript)

Understanding this concept opens the door to using functional programming in
JavaScript.  Functional programming is widely used in modern JavaScript because
it neatly solves commonly encountered problems.

*   Anonymous functions
*   Scope of variables within functions
*   Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)



# [Automatic Semicolon Insertion](../JavaScript.md#automatic-semicolon-insertion)

They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Automatic semicolon insertion is perhaps JavaScript's most well-intentioned
feature with the worst consequences.



# [Debugging JavaScript](../JavaScript.md#debugging-javascript)

Your browser includes a very capable
[debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger) with all of
the features you expect.
