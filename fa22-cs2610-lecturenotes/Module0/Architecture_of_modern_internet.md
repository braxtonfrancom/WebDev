# The architecture of the modern internet

The internet, as we experience it today, is presented as a rich, multimedia landscape viewed through the lens of a web browser. A web browser takes as input plain-text documents written in **three** key languages:

0.  Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
1.  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
2.  JavaScript (JS)

These are combined with images, audio and video data and are displayed as beautiful, animated, musical and interactive vistas. All these data are transmitted to your computer using a **fourth** language called the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

My goal for you in this class is to help you come to understand how to use these four languages to create dynamic content so you can claim your own place on the internet.


### How did we get here?

The internet hasn't always looked like this, and what you are able to see in your browser isn't the totality of the internet.

What we now casually refer to as "the internet" was once called the "World Wide Web" to distinguish it from other computer network technologies used throughout the 1980's and early 1990's.  You may have heard of some of these technologies before:

*   DNS
*   Email
*   FTP
*   BBS
*   Gopher
*   Kermit
*   Telnet
*   Usenet
*   IRC
*   OSCAR (AOL Instant Messenger)

Some have since fallen into disuse while others have evolved and migrated onto HTTP.  Because HTTP and HTML have come to dominate the internet landscape the cumbersome phrase "World Wide Web" has fallen by the wayside and we now conflate "the web" with "the 'net".


### Birth of the World Wide Web

At this time people primarily accessed the internet through text terminals, and most network protocols were used to exchange plain text documents.

HTML was envisioned as a way to create rich, multimedia experiences online.  Berners-Lee designed HTML by building upon an existing markup language called SGML.  He designed the HyperText Transfer Protocol to share HyperText documents and media files over a network.  And finally, he created the first web browser to receive and display HTML documents.  His creation transformed the world overnight as the internet became easily accessible to ordinary people.
