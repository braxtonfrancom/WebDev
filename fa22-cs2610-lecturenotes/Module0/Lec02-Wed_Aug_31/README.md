# Action Items

*   Work through the **Required Software Installation Instructions** on Canvas.
*   Use the [Shell Tutor](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/erik.falor/shell-tutor) if you need a refresher on Git and the CLI.


## Call on 2 designated questioners



# Assignment #0: Static Blog with HTML & CSS (Web 1.0)

Create a static website for a fictional client to learn the basics of web technologies.



# [Unix command line basics](../../Unix_CLI.md)

A lot of modern web dev tools are used in a Unix-style command line interface
(CLI).  You will use some of these tools throughout this semester.  Learning a
new interface takes time, and the command shell can be especially intimidating.

Be patient with yourself!  It just takes practice.

*	I created the [Shell Tutor](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/erik.falor/shell-tutor) to help you get this practice in a guided environment.
	*	The tutor consists of seven guided lessons
	*	Each lesson should take about 20 minutes to complete
*	I have written a primer on important CLI concepts (linked above)
*	You can also find help in the Free Software and Linux Club Discord server

Mastering the CLI is simply a matter of practice.  Start today and don't put it off.  By the end of the semester you will be *very* comfortable here.

 
## [Shell Command Cheatsheet](../../Shell_Cheatsheet.md)

Part of your site will be an HTML cheatsheet, which is as much for your benefit
as it is to meet the requirements of the assignment.  If you're new to using
the command-line it would be a good idea to document the new commands and
concepts that you're learning, and you are welcome to replace some HTML
concepts with command shell material if you want.



# Git refresher

(Almost) every assignment will be submitted to my GitLab server using Git.  Git has a learning curve that can be overcome with frequent practice

*	Git vastly streamlines the assignment submission process for both you and the graders
*	If you ever have any questions about your code it is very easy for me and the TA's to see exactly what your code is doing
	*	Just push your code to your GitLab repository
	*	Send us a message with the URL to your GitLab repository
	*	We can clone your repository onto our own computer and experience the exact same bug
	*	You get better help faster!
*	Git is widely used in industry
	*	Almost *everything* related to web dev has a Git repository
	*	Knowing how to use Git is a skill that *will* pay off
*	Use Git for your other classes
	*	You are welcome to put your code/projects/papers/etc. on my GitLab server
	*	Repositories there are private by default


Everything you need to get started with Git is already at your fingertips:

*	Start with the **Required Software Installation Instructions**
    *   This is on Canvas because it contains videos
	*	This ensures that Git is installed and ready to run on your computer
*	[Using Git](../../Using_Git/README.md) 
    *   Refer to this resource as your **first resort** before reaching out to TAs for Git help


**The [Shell Tutor](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/erik.falor/shell-tutor) is also available for you, too!**



# [The Hyper Text Markup Language](../HTML.md)

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language.  If you want to think of HTML as source code, then the machine that uses it is a web browser. There are many programs besides web browsers which use HTML to describe the visual appearance of data (mail clients, smartphone apps, desktop apps), but in this class we focus on browsers.

The latest version of HTML is version 5. This is the version we will use for all purposes in this course.



# Required HTML5 Elements for Assignment 0

You must use each of the following elements on Assignment 0:

0.  `title`
1.  `h1`
2.  `h2`
3.  `p`
4.  `code`
5.  `ol`
6.  `ul`
7.  `li`
8.  `a`
9.  `img`


Their form and function are documented on the Mozilla Developer Network's [HTML
elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).
You are expected to **read** and follow this documentation as part of this
assignment!

Let's write a [new webpage](./index.html) from scratch and try them out.  You
don't need a special program to write webpages; a simple text editor is enough
to get started.  I encourage you to experiment on this file on your own to get
comfortable with HTML's syntax.
