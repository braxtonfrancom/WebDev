# Get to know your professor

Hi, I'm Erik Falor, and I'm your professor this semester.

I graduated with a Master's degree from USU in Fall 2016 and have been teaching
here ever since.  Before that I worked as a software engineer for 13 years at
Spillman Technologies, Inc. (now Motorola Solutions) and Automated Products
Group.

This document is already *required* in this course, and it is necessary if you want their help.  The TAs and I will also ask for your plan when you come to us for help about assignments.

# [Software Development Plan](../../Software_Development_Plan.md)

*   This will be a required part of every assignment in which you write code
    *   It is not required for Assignment 6 **Hack the Planet!**, because that assignment has no code
*   Although the above template is a Markdown file, you will submit your Plan as an HTML file
    *   This is a web development course, after all!
*   Plan on spending 50% of your time *designing* your solution before writing any code
    *   Don't write your plan *after* writing your code
    *   You're doing it wrong
    *   I can totally tell that's what you did
