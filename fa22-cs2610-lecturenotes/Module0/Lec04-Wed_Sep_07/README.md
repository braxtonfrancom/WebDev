Do you dream of the day when you can finally break into an enemy system (wearing a black hoodie in a dark room somewhere) and dramatically say "I'm in."? Have you ever wanted to learn how to (ethically) crack passwords, steal credentials (that are yours), break into websites (with permission), hide sensitive info in cat pics (why not), or write your own malware? (for legal reasons, that's a joke)

If so, come check out CyberSentinels! Even if none of those things sound interesting to you yet, come for the food then stay for the hacking! For more info, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YbB9zuD7f6)

# HTML Recap

It's been a long weekend.  Let's quickly come back up to speed with what we know about HTML by writing a second webpage that links to our [index.html](./index.html)



# Validating HTML using W3C's online tool

Since the browser is not very helpful when it comes to detecting HTML errors,
we must turn to another tool for this insight.

One of the requirements of the next assignment is that your webpage(s)
correctly follow the HTML5 standard according to the W3C Markup Validation
Service.  This tool will help you find trouble spots in your document.
