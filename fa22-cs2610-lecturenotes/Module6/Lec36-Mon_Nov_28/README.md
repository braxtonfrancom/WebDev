## IDEA Surveys - Rare Extra Credit Opportunity

You should have received a notification about the IDEA Student Rating of Instruction (SRI) survey.

Your feedback is very important to me, and I really want you to take this survey.  Each semester I take many useful suggestions and incorporate them into my future courses.  If I'm doing anything right, it is due to suggestions given by previous students.

The more input I get from you the better I am able to improve as an instructor.  My goal is to reach 80% participation.  To that end I am offering 25 points of sweet, sweet *extra credit* for your response.  This is the *only* extra credit I give.  Your responses remain anonymous, and I will not even see them until after finals week.

*   The extra points will be automatically applied to your grade on Canvas by the University **at the end of Finals Week**
    *   There is nothing that I can do to speed this up, or verify that your submission was accepted - **it's anonymous!**
    *   Your points will come through; trust the system
*   The survey opens on Monday, November 21st at 8:00 AM.
*   The survey closes Friday, December 9th at 11:59 PM.


## Free Software and Linux Club

*   **What**  LISP - the reason your programming language has any redeeming qualities at all
*   **When**  6:30pm Wednesday, November 30th
*   **Where** ESLC 053, [FSLC Discord server](https://discord.gg/p4jRxrQmqP)

This week in the FSLC we'll be looking at LISP - its history, its wide-spread influence that every programming language these days inherits from, as well as its formal definition - by taking a look at some parts of McCarthy's original paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine (part one)".

We'll also learn how to get started writing some practical applications in the aptly-named most widespread and used dialect of LISP, Common Lisp.

If you're interested in functional programming, this is where it all started $`2^{6}`$ years ago! Come check it out in ESLC 053 at 6:30PM Wednesday evening, or attend virtually on Zoom.

# [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)

*There are questions on the final exam pertaining to this code of ethics that governs professional software development*

Some highlights from that document:

## 1. GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

**A computing professional should...**


### 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing

> This principle, which concerns the quality of life of all people, affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society, its members, and the environment surrounding them. This obligation includes promoting fundamental human rights and protecting each individual's right to autonomy. **An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to health, safety, personal security, and privacy**.



#### What does this mean to you?

*   With great power comes great responsibility
    *   If you hack/make something, there will be consequences
*   The human component of the cyber system has a lot of power - they are often the weakest link.  Your actions can affect 100k's of people.


### 1.2 Avoid harm

> In this document, "harm" means negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust.

Blow the whistle, but be careful in doing so

> A computing professional has an additional obligation to report any signs of system risks that might result in harm. If leaders do not act to curtail or mitigate such risks, it may be necessary to "blow the whistle" to reduce potential harm. **However, capricious or misguided reporting of risks can itself be harmful**. Before reporting risks, a computing professional should carefully assess relevant aspects of the situation.


#### What does this mean to you?

*   ...
*   ...


### 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy

> A computing professional should be transparent and provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties. Making deliberately false or misleading claims, fabricating or falsifying data, offering or accepting bribes, and other dishonest conduct are violations of the Code. 

#### What does this mean to you?

*   What you say you will do with the data is what you actually do with it - transparency.
    *   Don't trick people into using your product, or make it unduly hard to unsubscribe/cancel
*   Don't be like the SE at Volkwagen and "cheat" the emissions test


### 1.6 Respect privacy

> The responsibility of respecting privacy applies to computing professionals in a particularly profound way. Technology enables the collection, monitoring, and exchange of personal information quickly, inexpensively, and often without the knowledge of the people affected. **Therefore, a computing professional should become conversant in the various definitions and forms of privacy and should understand the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information.**

> Computing professionals should only use personal information for legitimate ends and without violating the rights of individuals and groups.


#### What does this mean to you?

*   ...
*   ...


## 2. PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

**A computing professional should...**


### 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work

> "Rules" here include local, regional, national, and international laws and regulations, as well as any policies and procedures of the organizations to which the professional belongs. Computing professionals must abide by these rules unless there is a compelling ethical justification to do otherwise.

> A computing professional who decides to violate a rule because it is unethical, or for any other reason, **must consider potential consequences and accept responsibility for that action**.


#### What does this mean to you?

*   ...
*   ...


### 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good

> Consequently, computing professionals should not access another's computer system, software, or data without a reasonable belief that such an action would be authorized or a compelling belief that it is consistent with the public good. **A system being publicly accessible is not sufficient grounds on its own to imply authorization**. 

> Under exceptional circumstances a computing professional may use unauthorized access to disrupt or inhibit the functioning of malicious systems; extraordinary precautions must be taken in these instances to avoid harm to others.

#### What does this mean to you?

*   ...
*   ...


### 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure

> Breaches of computer security cause harm. **Robust security should be a primary consideration when designing and implementing systems. Computing professionals should perform due diligence to ensure the system functions as intended, and take appropriate action to secure resources against accidental and intentional misuse, modification, and denial of service.** As threats can arise and change after a system is deployed, computing professionals should integrate mitigation techniques and policies, such as monitoring, patching, and vulnerability reporting. Computing professionals should also take steps to ensure parties affected by data breaches are notified in a timely and clear manner, providing appropriate guidance and remediation.

> To ensure the system achieves its intended purpose, security features should be designed to be as intuitive and easy to use as possible. Computing professionals should discourage security precautions that are **too confusing, are situationally inappropriate, or otherwise inhibit legitimate use**.

> **In cases where misuse or harm are predictable or unavoidable, the best option may be to not implement the system.**

# Responsible disclosure

Finding bugs is fun and useful.  Being the first to find an important vulnerability makes you feel smart.  But, per ACM Code of Ethics 1.2, you need to be careful about *how* you let the world know how clever you are.


## Definitions

#### [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/)

0.  A list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws
    *   "The mission of the CVE® Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities"
    *   A project begun by the MITRE corporation in 1999 and is funded by the U.S. DHS
1.  The ID number which identifies a vulnerability
    *   "I heard that was a serious bug; do you have the *CVE*?"

The CVE organization identifies vulnerabilities by assigning unique ID numbers to each one

*   This makes it much easier for all of the different vulnerability databases to stay on the same page
*   Other organizations keep track of the severity, impact, and maintain fix information for the vulnerabilities
*   [Official CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/)
    *   The up-and-coming [beta version](https://www.cve.org/) of this website
*   [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/) more user-friendly interface

*Fun fact* In 2014 CVE changed the syntax of their ID numbers to include more digits because they ran out of numbers; the original format of CVE numbers was `CVE-YYYY-NNNN`, which allowed for at most 9,999 vulnerabilities per year.  On second thought, this fact is not so fun as it is *depressing*...


#### Proof-of-concept (PoC)

*   A piece of code that demonstrates a vulnerability
*   Can be used to test that a system is susceptible to an exploit
    *   A pre-test to find out if a patch is required
    *   A post-test to ensure the patch is effective
*   PoCs are found on mailing lists, discussion forums, the **dark web**, etc.
    *   [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/) a vulnerability database that uses CVE numbers
    *   [Full Disclosure](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure)

Example PoCs for patched vulnerabilities:

*   [Shell Shock PoCs](https://github.com/mubix/shellshocker-pocs)
*   [The Zero Day Initiative PoCs](https://github.com/thezdi/PoC)


#### Security Researcher

*   Anybody who finds vulnerabilities
    *   An Individual or Organization
    *   An Amateur or Professional
*   The only credential that matters is that you are looking for vulnerabilities
*   Technically, crackers are security researchers


#### Vendor

*   Producer of software
*   May be an individual, corporation, or open-source project


#### Zero-day Vulnerability (0-day)

*   A hole in software that is unknown to the vendor
    *   This security hole may then be exploited by crackers before the vendor becomes aware
    *   The vendor therefore has 0 days to fix the problem before customers are affected
*   The day the vulnerability is disclosed to the vendor is **day 0**
    *   This is the day the scramble to fix it begins


#### Window of Vulnerability

*   The time between the exploitation of a vulnerability and the application of the patch that fixes it
*   When the vendor knows about the vulnerability before attackers begin exploiting it, they can create and distribute a patch for it
    *   The existence of a patch can alert attackers to a vulnerability
    *   Sysadmins and end-users may not apply patches as soon as they are available
        *   Therefore the time between the publication of a patch and your application of it is critical
*   When an attacker discovers a vulnerability before the vendor, they can immediately begin to exploit it knowing that no mitigation is available
    *   Reports of exploited systems alert the vendor to the problem
    *   If you got it, make it count; using the vulnerability can therefore reduce its potential effectiveness by increasing the likelihood that somebody will fix it
    *   If you wait too long, somebody else may discover and fix it


> Within 24 hours of a vulnerability or exploit being released, it's weaponized and used against us
>
> David Hogue
> National Security Agency
> RSA Conference 2018
> San Francisco


#### Bug Bounty

*   A monetary reward offered in exchange for disclosing a vulnerability
*   I hope that pay better than the bad guys


#### Responsible Disclosure

A method of disclosing vulnerabilities that minimizes the possibility of the vulnerability being used before a patch is released.

*   In this model the **security researcher** discreetly reaches out to the **vendor** to report a vulnerability.
*   A **proof-of-concept** may be shared to convince the vendor that this is a serious threat
*   A timeline is agreed upon
    *   The vendor promises to release a patch in *N* days
    *   After which the security researcher can claim credit for discovering the flaw
    *   A bug bounty may be paid


There is some tension between vendors and researchers

*   Vendors can feel like hostages, being entirely at the whim of the researcher
    *   By refusing to work with the researcher as a peer, you may drive them to becoming a criminal
*   Researchers can feel like they're being given the run-around by vendors
    *   Instead of making a good-faith effort to fix the vulnerability they instead dismiss the report or try to buy off the researcher
    *   Some vendors outright dismiss vulnerability reports as *not a bug* or *WONTFIX*
    *   This convinces researchers that the best course of action is to release the vulnerability to *force* the vendor to respond



## Discussion


#### How can you disclose a software flaw responsibly?

*   ...
*   ...


### Responsible reporting mechanisms

*   Disclosure embargo
    -   When notifying a vendor set a deadline by which they must have the bug fixed or else you will publicize the vulnerability
    -   To "light a fire under their @$$" to make sure they can't brush you off
    -   Don't be a jerk and give them 3 days to respond from Friday
*   Bug bounty programs
    -   The companies/organizations invite you to look for vulnerabilities
*   Safe harbor clause
    -   Immunity from prosecution in exchange for your notification


### If your job relies on exploiting 0-days, do you report them?

The NSA was sued by the EFF in 2014 for the allegation that the agency would, in the course of their work, discover 0-day vulnerabilities and *not* report them to the vendor so they could make use of them.


#### Is it a good or bad thing for the NSA to hoard 0-day vulnerabilities?

*   Pros:

# Privacy

#### Authentication

Verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be


#### Authorization

Granting access rights or privileges to the correct entities

Ensuring that sensitive information is made available only to properly authenticated users, and that each user can access everything they *need* and *nothing* they do not.


## [Protecting user privacy](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)

*    Encrypt sensitive data
    *   Only transmit sensitive data using proven encryption systems
    *   Protect data-at-rest - i.e. within an encrypted database
*   Session management
    *   Do error messages convey too much information about how the system works?  There is such a thing as being too helpful.
    *   Enforce session timeouts
    *   Ensure sessions are re-opened when a new, sensitive operation is started
*   Username/password policy
    *   Should a username be a publicly known value such as an email address or derived from your name?
        *   i.e. bmccan or bella.mcc@gmail.com for Bella McCann?
        *   Did you know that before USU had A Numbers your student ID was your Social Security Number?
    *   Are weak passwords rejected?
        *   It takes a long time for a hacker to guess your password by sitting at a keyboard, but software can quickly do this work.
        *   How long would it take a computer to guess your password?  Find out with the Password Haystacks (Links to an external site.).
        *   Are your users allowed to use passwords that appear in publicly available password dictionaries (Links to an external site.)?
    *   Is your password policy burdensome or annoying?
        *   Does the UI reject new passwords only after the user has already entered it, without offering helpful feedback along the way?
        *   Does your system impose a maximum length on passwords, or restrict which kinds of special characters a password may contain?
            *   Phrases consisting of many words are better than random, hard-to-remember passwords.  You might be surprised at how many websites disallow phrases containing spaces!
        *   Does your system force users to needlessly change their password every N days?
            *   This is a sure-fire way to get passwords like $uper Secret0, $uper Secret1, $uper Secret2, ...
*   Brute-force protection
    *   Does your system allow thousands of login attempts per minute?
        *   If so, what are you thinking?
    *   What happens when the account is locked out?
        *   Do you have useful account recovery options?
        *   Can your system revoke compromised accounts without breaking the application?
    *   CAPTCHAs are more user-friendly and better than ever
*   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    *   Better security is achieved by combining something you know with something you have
    *   Most users have a smartphone and 2FA apps are plentiful
    *   However imperfect and annoying 2FA may be, it really does stop a lot of attacks!
