# Action Items


## Call on 2 designated questioners



# [How does the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) work?](../HTTP.md)

A protocol is simply a system of rules which define how data is exchanged between systems, and the format of the data.

In this lecture you will learn what sorts of things can be said in HTTP and when they may be said.

## [HTTP Semantics](../HTTP.md#http-semantics)

## [HTTP Methods](../HTTP.md#http-methods)

## [HTTP Response Status Codes](../HTTP.md#http-response-status-codes)



# [HTTP Headers](../HTTP.md#http-headers)

HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response.

There are broad two categories of headers:

0.  **Request** headers are sent from client to server
1.  **Response** headers are sent from server to client



# [Experience HTTP requests and responses firsthand](../Experience-HTTP-firsthand.md)

HTTP is a simple plain-text protocol.  Typing out HTTP requests yourself is a great way to get "hands-on" experience and demystify what browsers and servers do.  I would like you to spend some time in the command shell with a text-based tool called `netcat` and have an HTTP "chat" with a real server.
