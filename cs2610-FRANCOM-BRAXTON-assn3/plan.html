            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>

            <p>
                My goal is to build a fully functional calculator using Javascript and Vanilla JS;).
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't worked with Javascript at all but I am actually really excited to become more familiar with it
                because it is so common. I think that it will be really cool to convert between HTML and Javascript. Some
                challenges that I forsee would be getting caught up in the strange syntax of Javascript. I'm hoping that I can
                learn Javascript with an open mind and not rely too much on my knowledge of other languages.
            </p>

            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                I will be taking in two number inputs and an operation. I will need to limit the input to numbers, otherwise I will run into
                errors trying to perform operations on said inputs. The operation will be selected by the user from a dropdown
                list of predefined operations. I will then evaluate the mathematical expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                My output will be a fully functioning Javascript calculator that will generate the correct output given
                the user's input values and operation selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                There really won't be any algorithms or formulae used in this program. Just good ol' HTML, CSS, and
                Javascript.
            </p>

        <div id="phase2">
            <h2>Phase 2: Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All of my work will be done in script.js. I will not modify the index.html page.
                </li>

                <li>
                    script.py
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            function calculator()
                                <p>In this function I will define all HTML elements and assign them their correct names, id's
                                attributes, and CSS styling.</p>
                                <p>I will also make a function call to append each time I want to create a new div.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            function append()
                                <p>In this function I will create a new date object. I will then verify that both of the
                                inout fields arent blank. If they are not black I will insert a new div that contains the
                                date object and the equation to calculate. </p>
                                <p>If one or both of the fields is empty, I will set the background color to red, set the
                                    textContent of the div to an error message and then insert the new div.</p>
                                <p>Lastly, I will put an event listener on every new div created. This will make it so that
                                when any of the divs created is clicked, it will be deleted.</p>
                        </li>

        <div id="phase3">
            <h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>

            <p>
                I implemented all of the above code and more, as well as made some slight modifications to the CSS starter
                code to create a functional Javascript calculator.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that Javascript is a very powerful tool. I also learned that it has some pretty unique and
                sometimes funky syntax. It can be quite tricky at times figuring those things out but this project helped
                me to develop a lot more confidence in my ability to use Javascript.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase4">
            <h2>Phase 4: Testing and Debugging</h2>

            <h4>Test Case: I tested the operation 4 + 27. </h4>
            <p>Result: The output was 31. This was the expected output.</p>

            <h4>Test Case: I attempted -2 ** 3.</h4>
            <p>Result: I received an error message. To fix this I put parethesis around the two operands. This solved the
            problem and resulted in the correct output.</p>

            <h4>Test Case: I did 4 + 4 which resulted in a new div that displayed '4 + 4 = 8' I then tried clicking the div
            to delete the message.</h4>
            <p>Result: The div disappeared as it should without any issues. </p>

        </div>

        <div id="phase5">
            <h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>

            <p>
                My project has been pushed to gitlab.
            </p>

            <h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>

            <p>
                My program is written quite well. I feel that my program isn't too complex and could be understood by just
                about anyone with any sort of Javascript knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand how all the parts of my program work. The complexity in this project is actually quite simple
                once you begin to understand Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bug was reported in a few months, I am very confident I would be able to find the cause very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my documentation would make sense to myself in six months time and to anyone besides myself
                who understands Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be able to add a new feature very easily to this project in a year because the program is quite
                simple and Javascript organizes everything quite nicely.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project should continue to work after upgrading my computers hardware, the operating system, and the
                next versions of Javascript unless there was a major overhaul done on the syntax of Javascript which I
                wouldn't put past them ;).
