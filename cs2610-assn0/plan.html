        <div id="phase0">
            <h1>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h1>

            <p>My end goal is to make a functioning blog. This blog will be made using HTML and css.
            I have used some HTML and css before in the past so I am looking forward to refreshing
            those skills. I am still not completely sure how I am going to implement some of the color
            schemes but I am sure with a little research I can figure out these problems.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase1">
            <h1>Phase 1: System Analysis</h1>

            <p>
                There really isn't much input into the program besides the user interacting with the blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                My output will be a fully functioning blog with several pages and a navigation bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                No algorithms will be used in this program.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase2">
            <h1>Phase 2: Design</h1>

            <p>
                There won't be any specific functions that will be used in this assignnment. Instead,
                this assignment will consist of a mix of html layouts and css styling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good output will be a functional html website.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will have 4 webpages. These 5 webpages will be a homepage, an about page, a tech tips page(with CSS styling)
                and a tech tips page(without CSS styling).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase3">
            <h1>Phase 3: Implementation</h1>

            <p>
                I implemented all of the HTML and CSS to create this 4 page website.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase4">
            <h1>Phase 4: Testing and Debugging</h1>

            <p>
                There wasn't much testing that needed to be done. I did run all of my HTML and CSS code through validators to
                ensure that the code and syntax is correct. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase5">
            <h1>Phase 5: Deployment</h1>

            <p>
                My project has been pushed to gitlab.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase6">
            <h1>Phase 6: Maintenance</h1>
            
            <p>
                My program is written quite well. However, there were some parts that were not written as succinctly as they
                could have been. This is due to me trying to use some CSS selectors to satisfy the requirements of the assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand how all the parts of my program work. There really isn't much complexity in this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bug was reported in a few months, I would be able to find the cause very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my documentation would make sense to myself in six months time and to anyone besides myself due to the 
                simplistic nature of this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be able to add a new feature such as an additonal webpage very easily to this project in a year beacuse the
                layout of the project is quite simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project would continue to work after upgrading my computers hardware, the operating system, and the next versions
                 of HTML and CSS.
