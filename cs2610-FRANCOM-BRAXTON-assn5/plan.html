        <div id="phase0">
            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>

            <p>
                My goal is to build a fully functional weather app using Vue.js as a framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to work with Vue.js. I have heard a lot of good things about it. I think the biggest challenge for me in this
                assignment will be learning how Vue.js works. Once I figure that out, I don't think the implementation of the rest of the 
                assinment will be that difficult.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase1">
            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                I will be using multiple API's to get data relating to the weather and forecast. This data will be returned as a json object.
            </p>
            <p>
                My output will be a webpage that displays all of the information I extract from the json objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                There really won't be any algorithms or formulae used in this program. The program will mostly be fetch() calls and then accessing
                the data in the json objects that those fetch()'s return.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase2">
            <h2>Phase 2: Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I will have a script.js, index.html, and style.css page.
                </li>

                <li>
                    script.js
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I am going to leave this file blank. For this project, I found it more convienient to have my script inline in index.html
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    index.html
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In index.html I am going to have a basic html layout with dynamic Vue data inserted throughout. The individual divs in this
                            layout will be conditionally rendered using Vue directives. 
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            In my Vue.createApp() I will have the following four sections: 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1. data() - In here I will define any data that will need to be passed into the html body as a dynamic element. Some of this data
                            will be json objects that will come from API calls. I will also have a "error" data element that I will set to undefined. If an error
                            develops while the API fetch() calls, the error message will be printed to the screen because of conditionals I will have in my html
                            layout that check to see if error === undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. methods() - I think I will only need one method in here. It it will be a method that takes in an event(such as a click). It will then
                            look at the current state of the div that was just clicked and determine the color that it needs to be changed to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3. computed() - Here, I will have three methods. The three methods will be nearly identical. They will be unlikely(), likely(), and neutral().
                            Their job will be to keep the count of the repective states of all the forty divs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            4. created() - Everything in here will be automatically called when the app is created. In here I will have three API calls. The first will be
                            to get the current location of the person using the website. The second will use that location to get the current weather for that location, and 
                            the third will be to get the forecast for the next five days for that location. I will promise chain these API calls so that I can catch errors simply
                            and efficiently.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    style.css
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            My stylesheet will have basic css selectors that will style my weather app.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="phase3">
            <h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                I implemented all of the above code to create a functional weather single-page web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that Vue.js is a very functional framework. Once you learn how it works, it's implementation is actually
                pretty simple. It can be very powerful and can make dynamic webpages simple.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase4">
            <h2>Phase 4: Testing and Debugging</h2>

            <h4>Test Case: I loaded the webpage as normal by opening a browser window to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html</h4>
            <p>Result: The webpage loaded with the correct location, date, time, and weather information.</p>

            <h4>Test Case: I tried clicking on of the 40 divs in the 5 day 3-hour forecast.</h4>
            <p>Result: The div changed color each time I clicked it and the numbers that keep counts were updated correctly.</p>

        </div>

        <div id="phase5">
            <h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>

            <p>
                My project has been pushed to gitlab.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="phase6">
            <h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>

            <p>
                My program is written quite well. I think that anyone who is familiar with HTML, CSS, and a basic knowledge of
                frameworks would be able to understand this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand how all the parts of my program work. Vue.js is not a very complicated framework. It is powerful, but
                simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bug was reported in a few months, I am very confident I would be able to find the cause very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my documentation would make sense to myself in six months time and to anyone else who understands
                Javascript, HTML, and CSS
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be able to add a new feature very easily to this project in a year because the program is quite
                simple due to the use of Vue.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project should continue to work after upgrading my computers hardware, the operating system, and the
                next versions of Javascript, or Vue.js.
