            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>

            <p>
                My goal is to build a webpage that will be able to tell someone the dollar value of a weight in gold. I also 
                would like to have my website be able to convert between different units of conversion including lbs, oz, troy oz, 
                grams, kilagrams, and U.S. Tons.
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't worked much with Javascript but I am actually really excited to become more familiar with it
                because it is so common. I think the biggest challenge that I forsee is figuring out what to do in HTML and what to 
                do in Javascript. I feel like I could do most things in either but I am not sure what is the ideal way to approach
                individual tasks.
            </p>

        <div id="phase1">
            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                I will be taking in a number input and the user will select a unit of conversion from a dropdown menu. I will need to limit the input to numbers, otherwise I will run into
                errors trying to perform operations on said input. I will then need to appropriately convert the the units into whatever the user requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                My output will be the dollar amount of the weight entered in gold based on the current gold value.
            </p>
            <p>
                There really won't be any algorithms or formulae used in this program. The only 'algorithms' of sorts will
                be the simple conversion factors used in this program.
            </p>

        <div id="phase2">
            <h2>Phase 2: Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    gold app:
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This app will be done mostly in a javascript script. I will make the base layout using DOM manipulation.
                            There will br two fetch() calls. One before the button is clicked to get the price of gold from an
                            API. The other will be called once the button is clicked. This one will call my unit conversion API
                            to convert the selected units to troy ounces. When the '=' button is clicked, it will call the followiong function:  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            convert()--> This function will make a fetch() to my unit conversion API. It will get the weight in troy ounces
                            which we can multiply with the current price of gold. We will then display this calculated value in a new div 
                            that we add to the DOM.  
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    unitconv app:
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This app will have very minimalist HTML body. The work for this app will be done in views in a function called
                            convert().
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            convert(request)--> This function will take a request in. After ensuring that it contains all the necessary pieces
                            I will calculate a value based on the values contained within the request. It will be something like
                            float(value) / from * to. This will give us the value of the converted number. I wll then return the value of the
                            converted number and the units we are converting to in a JsonResponse.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>

            <p>
                I implemented all of the above code and more to create a functional webpage that can perform the above described operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned once again that Javascript is a very powerful tool. I also learned that it's syntax can be decieving at times. 
                It can be quite tricky at times figuring those things out but this project helped me to develop a lot more confidence in my
                ability to use Javascript as well as become more comfortable working with URL's.

            <h2>Phase 4: Testing and Debugging</h2>

            <h4>Test Case: I tested putting 4 U.S Tons into the gold app by typing 4 into the input box and selecting U.S Tons from the dropdown menu.</h4>
            <p>Result: A new div appeared at the very top beneath the main div. It displayed 'At Fri Nov 11 2022 19:26:14 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time),
                 4 tons of gold is worth $205,887,585.79'. This was the expected output. </p>

            <h4>Test Case: I typed 'http://localhost:8000/unitconv/convert?from=g&to=lb&value=76' into my browser. </h4>
            <p>Result: The webpage returned the following JSON object: {"units": "lb", "value": 0.16755039706780697}. This is the expected
                output.
            </p>

            <h4>Test Case: I pressed the '=' button on the gold app without entering a value into the input box.</h4>
            <p>Result: A new div appeared at the very top beneath the main div. It displayed 'Fri Nov 11 2022 19:35:59 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time) You didn't enter anything man!'</p>

            <p>
                My project has been pushed to gitlab.

            <h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>

            <p>
                My program is written quite well. I feel that my program isn't too complex and could be understood by just
                about anyone with any sort of Javascript knowledge. They would need to have some knowledge about API's, fetch()
                requests, GET requests, etc. to understand what is going on behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand how all the parts of my program work. It took me some time to understand how all of the pieces work
                together but it actually isnt too bad once you understand how it all fits together.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bug was reported in a few months, I am very confident I would be able to find the cause very quickly and would
                be able to solve it quite quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my documentation would make sense to myself in six months time and to just about anyone besides myself
                who understands Javascript as well as has a basic understanding of fetch() requests, API's and other general knowledge
                for a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be able to add a new feature very easily to this project in a year because the program isn't too complex.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project should continue to work after upgrading my computers hardware, the operating system, and the
                next versions of Javascript, HTML and CSS unless there was a major overhaul done on the syntax of Javascript or something
                crazy like that which I would highly doubt because that would cause a lot more issues than messing up my two-page website.
