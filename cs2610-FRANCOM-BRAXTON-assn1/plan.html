            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>

            <p>
                My goal is to build a fully functional HTTP server. It will be able to interpret HTTP requests and form
                valid responses. It will also be able to use HTTP status codes to control the browser and redirect
                requests to different resources as well as be able to send custom response headers. In addition to these
                requirements, I would like my server to be able to serve HTML, CSS, and image files and properly display
                them. Lastly, I would like my server to be able to serve dynamically-generated pages, and gracefully
                handle client caused errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be honest, I am pretty unfamiliar with everything. Obviously, I have already written my HTML and CSS
                webpages so I am quite familiar with that aspect of the project, but I have a lot of learning to do in
                order to be able to understand how I am going to serve these webpages to my server.

            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                The data in this program will be taken from our last assignment. We are going to be using HTML, CSS, and
                JPEG files. We will 'serve' these files onto the server which will have to be able to properly handle all
                of the different formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                My output will be a fully functioning HTTP server. It will properly load all of the pages and navigate
                around the site effectively. It will be able to smoothly handle both correct and incorrect searches in the 'search
                bar'.
            </p>
            <p>
                There won't be any algorithms or formulae used in this program.

                        <p>This function will inspect self.path and then respond in the correct manner.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To do this, I will have if/elif/else statements that will inspect self.path and respond accordingly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There will be no parameters passed into the function besides self</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the case of good input: The function will go to the correct if/elif statement and will send
                            the appropriate headers.</p>
                        <p>In the case of bad input: The function will default to the else statmetn and will return a 404
                            Not Found error.</p>

                <li>
                    openFile(self, string(string)):
                        <p>This function will take a string file name into it. It will then read that file and then close
                            the file. At this point I will send a Content-Length header by taking the length of the opened
                            file. Then I will need to end headers and then write this opened file to the server.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To do this I will need to use open(), read(), close(), and then use self.send_header,
                            self.end_headers(), and self.wfile.write() </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The only parameter passed into the function will be a string. This string is a filename that I
                            will use in open()</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the case of good input: The function will take the string which is a file name and open
                            it. It will then send extract some information(Content-length) and send it as a header. Then
                            the opened file will be served.</p>
                        <p>In the case of bad input: The bad input will never reach this point because if it is an invalid
                            file name, openFile() will never be called. It is only called when there is a valid filename
                            given.</p>

                    sendHeaders(self, contentType(string), statusCode(string)):
                        <p>This function will send the appropriate headers when a html request is given. It will determine
                            which headers need to be sent based on the statusCode.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I will have several if/elif statements that send different status responses</p>
                        <p>Then I will have several self.send_header's that all send unique headers</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The contentType parameter will be used when sending the Content-Type header. This will determine
                            if the file is a jpeg, html, css, etc.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the case of good input: The function will send the appropriate headers.</p>
                        <p>In the case of bad input: The function will hit the else statement which will send a 404 code. This will handle
                            all invalid input.</p>

            <p>
                I implemented all of the above functions and other code to create a functional server.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that formatting is very important when sending headers. This frustrated me for quite some time
                until I realized the just of how formatting works and then it was quite easy.

                My project has been pushed to gitlab.

            <p>
                My program is written quite well. I feel that my program became simpler as I coded becasue I was able to
                condense a lot of the code into functions. This made the code for my server very short with lots of
                function calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand how all the parts of my program work. The complexity in this project is simplified quite a
                bit by the use of functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bug was reported in a few months, I am very confident I would be able to find the cause very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my documentation would make sense to myself in six months time and to anyone besides myself
                due to the use of functions for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would be able to add a new feature very easily to this project in a year because the layout of the
                project is quite simple with the use of functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project should continue to work after upgrading my computers hardware, the operating system, and the
                next versions of Python or web browser unless there was a major overhaul done on the syntax of the
                http.server library.
